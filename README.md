# LightgunDragoon
Panzer Dragoon Remake was not meant to be played with a lightgun and even with this plugin, the gameplay will differ from a classic lightgun title.

The crosshair is moved by the relative movement of the lightgun on the screen, it is not positioned absolutely. I tried to match the movements as much as possible, but an exact match was not possible due to the different control concepts. This is like emulating a joystick with a lightgun.

There is an outer border that takes up ten percent of the screen. If you hold the lightgun in that area, flight maneuvers are executed to change the position of the dragon rider and dodge attacks.

The inner area of the screen is meant for taking a semi-stable flight position, aiming and firing.

Just try it out, move the lightgun slowly across the screen and see how the game reacts. After a short while you should get the hang of it.

You need a lightgun with two additional, assignable buttons. Assign Q and E to turn around while flying.

How to use:
- Download the release zip
- Extract it into the main folder of the game
- Run the game
- Make sure that input mode is set to classic and sensitivity to 1.0
